# Symbione
*Inspired by the vastness of space and the intricate connections of human emotion, with a visual theme reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar."*

### The Genesis of the Name

**Symbione** is a portmanteau of "symbiosis" and "one."

**Symbiosis** describes a close and long-term interaction between two different biological species. Often, this relationship is mutually beneficial, creating a system where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

By adding **"one,"** we extend this concept to humanity's collective consciousness. Symbione aims to create a unified, symbiotic understanding of global events, not just by what is happening, but by how it makes us *feel*. It brings together disparate news sources into a single, emotionally coherent landscape.
